## Autocleaver

A translator to turn our normal, full-text tutorials into files ready for [Cleaver](https://github.com/jdan/cleaver) presentations.

### How to run it

Use the `autocleave` rake task:

`rake autocleave['path_to_markdown_file']`

By default, a file called `output_file.html` will be placed in the current
directory.
